# DSA Patterns

This repository contains important Data Structures & Algorithms patterns that frequently appear in coding interviews.

Each pattern folder includes:
- Explanation of when to use the pattern
- Template approach
- Multiple LeetCode problems solved using that pattern

This serves as my personal interview handbook.
